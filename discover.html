  <h1>RATAN TATA - A True Inspiration</h1>
  <p>
    In 2008, during the horrific terrorist attacks on the Taj Hotel in Mumbai, many lives were lost, and hundreds were affected. The hotel, owned by the Tata Group, became the center of national grief.
  </p>
  <p>
    What followed was a silent yet powerful response from Ratan Tata. Without media attention or press releases, he personally visited the families of every employee who was injured or killed â€” regardless of their job level. 
  </p>
  <p>
    He ensured that:
    <ul>
      <li>Their families received full medical and financial support</li>
      <li>Children's education was paid for</li>
      <li>Not a single employee lost their job</li>
      <li>Vendors and street-side workers around the hotel were also compensated</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Ratan Tata's humility and compassion during this crisis made him more than just a business icon â€” he became a symbol of humanity and silent leadership.
