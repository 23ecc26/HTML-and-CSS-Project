# HTML-and-CSS-Project
This project was developed using basic HTML and CSS as an inspiration tribute to Ratan Tata. It aims to motivate others by showcasing not only his achievements, but also his humanity through real-life stories and visuals. It is also a stepping stone in learning front-end web development.
